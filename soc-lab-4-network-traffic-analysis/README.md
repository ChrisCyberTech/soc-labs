# 🧪 Lab 4 – Network Traffic Analysis (Wireshark + Nmap)

**Status:** In Progress  
**Date Started:** 2025-11-07  
**Lab Goal:** Capture and analyze network traffic generated by Nmap scans between Workstation01 and DC01 using Wireshark.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

| Tool | System | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| Wireshark | macOS (host) | Packet analysis / pcap review |
| Wireshark | Workstation01 (VM) | Live packet capture during scans |
| Nmap | Workstation01 (VM) | Generate network traffic (host discovery, port scans, service detection) |

## 🧪 Planned Nmap Commands

```powershell
nmap -sn <DC01-IP>
nmap -sS <DC01-IP> -p 1-1024
nmap -sV <DC01-IP>
nmap -A <DC01-IP>   # (optional aggressive scan)
🔎 Useful Wireshark Filters
Purpose	Filter
ICMP (ping traffic)	icmp
SYN packets (port scan)	tcp.flags.syn == 1 and tcp.flags.ack == 0
Reset responses	tcp.flags.reset == 1
Traffic to/from DC01	ip.addr == <DC01-IP>
DNS traffic	dns
SMB traffic	smb

📝 Notes & Findings (to fill later)
Example: Observed ICMP echo request/reply during nmap -sn scan

Example: SYN scan results matched open ports returned by Nmap

Example: DC01 responded with RST to closed ports, confirming normal TCP behavior
